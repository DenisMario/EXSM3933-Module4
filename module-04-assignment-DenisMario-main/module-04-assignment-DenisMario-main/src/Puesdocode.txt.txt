John wants a program that will continually prompt the user to enter a name until they enter the word “stop” exactly (case insensitive). If the name contains any numbers, it will discard the name and ask again. 
If the name contains the word “stop” but also other characters, it should be treated as a name. 
Once the user enters the word stop, the program will output the number of names that have been entered. 

Start:

set the variable "count" to 0

Repeat loop:
            -Make user enter a valid name (no numbers)
            -set name to user input

If name is "stop" (case insensitive) 
    Output count
    Stop program

If name contains numbers
    Output "Error, name cannot contain numbers."

Else if name contains "stop"
    Increase count by 1

Else
    Output "Name entered: " + name

Stop Loop

End
